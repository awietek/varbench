# Classical Variational Benchmarks for Digital Quantum Simulators  

Benchmark data is presented in folders that correspond to different models.
For example, the folder `TfIsing` contains data for the Transverse-Field Ising model.

The folders contain benchmark results on several lattices, and contain the following information.

`Energy`: the total Energy of the system

`Sigma`: the statistical error on the mean of the energy (for methods where this is relevant)

`Energy Variance`: the value of <H^2> - <H>^2 for the given method

`Method`: name of the method used with a short description of the parameters (if relevant)

`Data Repository`: if present, it points to the location of the data necessary to reproduce the result
