# Heisenberg Model


The model is defined on the edges of an arbitray graph and reads
$ H = J \sum_<i,j> \vec{\sigma}_i \cdot \vec{\sigma}_j  $
where we take Pauli matrices $\sigma^{x,y,z}_i$.
It is assumed that the units of energy are $ J=1 $.

## Naming

The name of the data files follows the convention `lattice_N.md`

---

`lattice` is the name of the lattice, also containing its extent/further information needed to specify the specific lattice, including its periodic boundary conditions. See `lattice.md` in the main repository for further information and examples.

`N` is the total number of spins
